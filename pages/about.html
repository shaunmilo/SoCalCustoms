                <h1>About Bryan Fross</h1>
                    <p class="aboutText">A Sophomore Photography class in High School initially caught Bryan's attention as something creative to do. After spending the rest of his High School days shooting mostly on Black & White film and developing his own pictures in the dark room, his lifelong photographic journey had just begun. </p>
<p class="aboutText">His passion for photography coupled with his love of custom vehicles made taking pictures at custom car and truck shows a new obsession.  Friends began requesting to see their vehicles as well as the other vehicles from recent shows. It became clear that it would be easier to purchase a domain name and host the pictures on the website to share with the masses.</p>

                <h2>SoCal Customs</h2>
                <h4>SoCalCustoms.com first appeared on-line March 1, 2000 as an alternative to printed magazines.</h4>
                <p class="aboutText">Automotive Enthusiasts at that time had accepted the traditional wait times of up to three months to see pictures in a magazine from the events that these die-hard, car-crazed individuals attended. SoCalCustoms.com changed this by providing these automotive lifestyle enthusiasts with pictures within 24 hours of every event attended. This approach quickly caught on and provided the baseline for the loyal following with new and return visitors alike. </p>
    <p class="aboutText">Originally covering only shows in Southern California, requests for shows in other states came pouring in almost immediately. SoCalCustoms.com then expanded in 2002 in order to satisfy the demand from website visitors worldwide. That year SoCalCustoms.com also added a features section to showcase some of the wildest custom vehicles and give our visitors an inside look at the work that goes into building everything from a cool customized cruiser to a rolling work of art. The next step to satisfy this continually growing fan base was to add models to the features as well as model interviews. These additions grew the visitor traffic even further and added more content for website visitors to browse through.</p>
<p class="aboutText">Today, the search continues for new ways to share custom vehicles with the masses while sticking to the goal of posting quality coverage with the speed readers have come to expect.
